# Life-Logger Manifesto

Life-Logger is a terminal utility to track your day in one-liners, à la Twitter or version control commits.
## Its differentiating features are:
* __It is a life logger, not a time tracker.__ You are encouraged and supposed to enter all significant actions performed during a day.
* __Logging is extremely fast and simple.__ The only required parameter is the title. Starting time and ending time are automatically calculated based on the ending time of the previous activity and the actual time of the log.
* __You maintain control over your data and it is always accessible and exportable.__ Everything is logged in a single _.txt_ file, so that you can edit it with any text editor that you want or export it somewhere else. You decide who you share it with.

## Other features (in or pending):
* Log an action
* View all logs for the current day
* Filter and view all logs within a set time interval


## Ideas for possible future features (uncleaned, definitely not trustworthy):
* Tag your logs
* Filter logs by tag and/or time interval + show the total number of hours spent on the chosen tag
* Show a graphic of the amount of hours spent on a chosen tag (all-time or within an optional time interval)
* Export/Publish as html+css
* Different kinds of entries: action log, summary of the day, idea, ...
