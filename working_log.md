# Pending
* View all logs for the current day
* Filter and view all logs within a set time interval
* Allow entering start time in various units, not only hours.


# Done
* First proof of concept: takes in a very basic syntax and calculates ending time and starting time
* First version of the readme/manifesto
* Log an action
* Display only date + time up to minutes: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (get rid of the seconds)
* Log an action now takes the finished time of the preceding log and considers it its starting time if no start_time is explicitly given
